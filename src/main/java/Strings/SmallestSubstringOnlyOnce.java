//Given a string S consisting of N lowercase alphabets, the task is to find the length of the smallest substring in
// S whose occurrence is exactly 1. (gfg)
//EG: S == "abaaba", opoutput = 2
///Approach: To solve the problem, the idea is to generate all possible substring of the given string S and store the
// frequency of each substring in a HashMap. Now, traverse the HashMap and print the substring of minimum
// length whose frequency is 1.
