//You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights,
// a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of the cell (row, col).
// You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and
// you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e.,0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right,
// and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
//A routeâ€™s effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
//Intution: If we need minimum effort mean we have to avoid bif elevations in the path, so we will have to avoid the maximum
//elevation from the all calculated elevation, i.e out of all difference between nodes avoid path which has max difference
// p1: 1-2-2-5  p2:1-3-5-5
//p1: max(1,0,3)=3, p2: max(2,2,2)=2
//so we chose p2 as it has minimum elevation or minimum(max diff)
